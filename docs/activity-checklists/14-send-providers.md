# Activity 14 — Send Providers

## Audit objective

This checklist follows every provider send from the composer and selected model through readiness, route resolution, transport, response validation, message/session persistence, retry/failover, and user-visible completion or failure. The audit covers MiCoder Auto Free, MiMo Serve, custom OpenAI-compatible providers, Ollama, OpenCode local, Local Agent, ACP, and web Kimi/Qwen/ChatGPT. It also includes the model/effort controls, compact and centered composers, API send bridge, attachments, first-send bootstrap, Stop, and web remote-chat UUID isolation.

Every chain was challenged with the devil’s-advocate question: **what if Serve is healthy but another route is selected, the effective model is stored outside `selectedModel`, the provider returns HTTP 200 with blank content, the browser emits an error without throwing, the remote chat UUID belongs to another host, or a retry succeeds only after the first attempt already typed text?**

The Linux Foundation harness verifies pure contracts and fake browser behavior. SwiftUI/AppKit rendering, WebKit DOM/cookies, real provider accounts, network delivery, clipboard behavior, and macOS SQLite remain **UNVERIFIED** unless stated otherwise.

## Provider matrix

| Provider route | Readiness contract | Trigger → route → transport | Response/error contract | Code quality | Task adherence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| MiCoder Auto Free | Catalog ready with at least one trusted temporary free model; selected model may be locked | Composer → `SendRouteResolver.autoFree` → `MiCoderAutoFreeStore.streamChat` → OpenCode Zen `/chat/completions` SSE | History, system prompt, attachments and parameters are carried; blank output fails; rate limit/model-unavailable can refresh and switch with visible notification; locked failure stops | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PASS by source/harness; live anonymous API and macOS UI UNVERIFIED.** |
| MiMo Serve | Selected provider ID must belong to the Serve catalog and `serverConnected` must be true | Composer → `.mimoServe` → `MimoServeClient.sendMessage` + SSE event stream | Stable session ID, waiting placeholder, session-busy abort/retry, 90-second timeout, typed visible error | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: deterministic/source checks pass; live Serve and SSE UNVERIFIED.** |
| Custom OpenAI-compatible | Enabled custom provider; required API key must be nonblank after trimming; Serve is not required | Composer → `.openAICompatible(baseURL, apiKey, effectiveModel)` → `DirectChatClient.send` → `/chat/completions` | History, files/images, system prompt and per-model parameters are sent; HTTP/transport/decode/blank response produce visible errors | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: request contracts pass; live endpoint and macOS UI UNVERIFIED.** |
| Ollama | Enabled local provider; own health route is probed independently of Serve | Composer → `.openAICompatible(localBaseURL + /v1, nil, effectiveModel)` → direct client | Model and multimodal content reach the local endpoint; no Serve fallback; blank response is rejected | 97/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: route/source contracts pass; live Ollama and runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| OpenCode local | Enabled local OpenCode provider; own endpoint is probed independently of Serve | Composer → `.openAICompatible(localBaseURL + /v1, nil, effectiveModel)` → direct client | Same direct request and error guarantees as Ollama; endpoint is not mislabeled as Serve | 97/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: route/source contracts pass; live OpenCode runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| Local Agent | Enabled local-agent endpoint; own readiness is independent | Composer → `.openAICompatible(localBaseURL, nil, effectiveModel)` → direct client | Uses the configured local-agent base URL and selected model, with visible transport/decode/blank-response failure | 97/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: source route pass; live endpoint UNVERIFIED.** |
| ACP custom/local | ACP provider or local ACP kind resolves to `.acp`; Serve is not required | Composer → ACP route → `ACPClient.sendChatCompletion` → ACP `/chat/completions` | Agent/variant/parameters and attachments are sent; blank content becomes typed ACP failure; no OpenAI fallback | 97/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: Foundation/source route pass; live ACP runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| Web Kimi | Configured web provider, valid saved session/cookies, discovered selectable model, route-specific connectivity | Composer → `.web(configID)` → verified project/chat/provider WebKit page → `WebChatDriver.runTurn` | Exact model/effort injected before typing; remote chat UUID verified; tool calls/approval/captcha/logout/errors visible; only a visible final event journals `send_completed` | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: 189-test harness and 12/12 adversarial checks pass; live Kimi WebKit/account runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| Web Qwen | Same route-specific web readiness and discovered-model contract | Same WebKit path with Qwen selectors/catalog | Model/effort and remote chat remain isolated; catalog refresh retries once without duplicate local assistant bubble or prompt | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: source/harness pass; live Qwen DOM/runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| Web ChatGPT | Same route-specific web readiness; no Serve-health shortcut | Same WebKit path with ChatGPT selectors/catalog | Missing/expired session, blank answer, injection failure, or browser error cannot be reported as success | 98/100 | 100/100 | **PARTIAL: source/harness pass; live ChatGPT runtime UNVERIFIED.** |

## Complete send-control matrix

| # | Control or chain | Trigger → handler → consumer | Expected behavior | Status |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Provider selector | `ProviderSelectorMenu` → `AppState.selectProvider` → provider/model state and connectivity refresh | Changing provider changes the route and effective model without retaining an incompatible model or effort. | **PASS by source; native menu runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| 2 | Model selector | `ModelSelectorMenu` → `AppState.selectModel` → provider config/store and `effectiveSelectedModel()` | Web and Auto Free labels/checkmarks show the actual routed model; parameters are keyed to that same ID. | **PASS; 3/3 presentation tests green.** |
| 3 | Effort/variant selector | `WebEffortMenu` or `VariantMenu` → provider config/selectedVariant → driver or Serve options | Unsupported web effort controls are hidden; supported effort is stored in the web config and injected only when available. | **PASS by source/harness; live DOM UNVERIFIED.** |
| 4 | Send readiness | Centered/Bottom composer → `SendReadinessLogic` → `SendProviderReadinessLogic` | Serve health cannot approve another route; web connectivity and effective model are part of readiness; blank input/model/provider errors are actionable. | **PASS; 3 Activity 14 readiness tests plus existing readiness suite green.** |
| 5 | First message bootstrap | `sendMessage` → route resolution → `prepareSessionBeforeAppending` → local session/currentSessionID → user+assistant persistence | The first user message is retained before transport, even when direct/web/Serve preflight or network delivery fails. | **PASS by source and prior persistence tests; project/runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| 6 | Custom/local direct send | `.openAICompatible` → `DirectChatClient.requestBody` → injectable/live transport → assistant update | Exact effective model, history, attachments and parameters reach the endpoint; HTTP and blank responses become visible failures. | **PARTIAL: pure request/response contracts pass; live endpoint UNVERIFIED.** |
| 7 | MiCoder Auto Free send | `.autoFree` → `streamChat` → history/attachment payload → SSE chunks → assistant message | The selected free model is used; context is preserved; empty response fails; failover refreshes/switches only when policy allows. | **PARTIAL: source/harness pass; anonymous network and visual notification UNVERIFIED.** |
| 8 | ACP send | `.acp` → ACP client → response text/usage → assistant message | ACP-specific route, agent, variant, parameters and multimodal payload are preserved; empty completion does not finish silently. | **PARTIAL: source/parser pass; live ACP response UNVERIFIED.** |
| 9 | Serve send | `.mimoServe` → `sendMessage` → SSE/client response merge → assistant/session | Serve only handles Serve IDs, maintains stable session identity, supports busy retry, and times out visibly. | **PARTIAL: source/harness pass; live Serve UNVERIFIED.** |
| 10 | Web browser send | `.web` → WebKit session restore → remote mapping → model/effort injection → `WebChatDriver` | No typing occurs before exact model/effort confirmation; browser errors are visible; only `.final` with visible text is completed. | **PASS by deterministic contract; live WebKit UNVERIFIED.** |
| 11 | Web chat isolation | project/workspace/session/provider → `webRemoteChatKey` → verified remote UUID/URL mapping | A new local project/chat starts a new remote chat; an existing mapping navigates to the same verified UUID; cross-host mappings fail closed. | **PARTIAL: Foundation/source checks pass; live remote pages UNVERIFIED.** |
| 12 | Web catalog refresh/retry | injection/model/effort failure event → bounded refresh → same page and remote mapping retry once | Refresh does not duplicate prompt text, local assistant bubble, or remote chat; no selectable model stops with an actionable status. | **PASS by source/harness; live failure injection UNVERIFIED.** |
| 13 | Approval gate | web tool event → `WebToolAccessGate` → `approvalRequired` → persistent chat status | Mutating tools stop before side effects at Ask before changes; the interrupted send is not marked completed or silently retried. | **PASS by harness/source; native approval interaction UNVERIFIED.** |
| 14 | Stop generation | Stop button → `stopGeneration` → task cancellation, web stop bridge, Serve abort, assistant finalization | Stop interrupts the active route and leaves a visible stopped state rather than an empty unfinished bubble. | **PARTIAL: source/harness path; native WebKit/AppKit runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| 15 | External API send | HTTP `/send` → provider/model selection → session selection/creation → `apiSendRequested` → normal ChatPanel send | API state and acknowledgement report the effective model for web/Auto Free and retain selected provider/session metadata. | **PARTIAL: 2/2 API metadata tests; actual HTTP/UI runtime UNVERIFIED.** |
| 16 | Error and blank response | transport/parser/driver event → typed error or visible assistant status → persistence and loading reset | HTTP errors, decode errors, blank direct/ACP output, browser timeout, logout, captcha, and iteration limit are never represented as an empty successful answer. | **PASS by source/harness; live runtime UNVERIFIED.** |

## Round 59 confirmed defects and fixes

### Route identity was bypassed by global Serve health

`SendReadinessLogic` returned success immediately when Serve was connected. This contradicted `SendRouteResolver`, which could then route the same message to an expired web session, disabled local provider, or custom route. `SendProviderReadinessLogic` now checks Auto Free, web, local, custom, and known Serve IDs independently. `AppState.refreshProviderConnectivity` also probes non-Serve providers even while Serve is healthy.

### Effective model was not used consistently

Web and Auto Free keep the actual routed model in provider-specific configuration while legacy `selectedModel` may be empty or stale. The stale value affected send preflight, compact/centered composer gates, model labels/checkmarks, parameter popovers, capability gates, direct route construction, ACP/Serve parameter lookup, web injection reconciliation, and API acknowledgements. `effectiveSelectedModel()` is now propagated through each of those consumers.

### Blank provider output was accepted as success

The direct client returned a `DirectChatResult` for whitespace-only content, and ACP mapped missing content to a finished empty bubble. `ProviderResponseValidationLogic` rejects blank output; DirectChatClient exposes `emptyResponse`, and ACP/ChatPanel use a typed visible failure. Auto Free already had an explicit empty-response guard, and web’s response wait already rejects an unchanged empty DOM.

### Web errors were journaled as completed sends

`runWebChatTurn` recorded `send_completed` after the driver returned, regardless of whether the driver emitted final text, an error, logout, captcha, iteration limit, injection failure, or no response. `WebSendCompletionLogic` and a thread-safe completion signal now require a visible `.final` event, including after the one bounded catalog-refresh retry.

### Canonical API metadata could report a blank model

The local HTTP API returned `appState.selectedModel`, which is not authoritative for web/Auto Free. `SendAPIResponseLogic` now reports the effective model in state, log, and send acknowledgement.

## Evidence and scores

| Check | Result | Boundary |
|---|---:|---|
| Full Foundation harness | **189/189 passed** | Linux-compatible deterministic contracts and fake browser runtime |
| New Activity 14 readiness tests | **3/3 passed** | Pure route/effective-model contract |
| New model presentation tests | **3/3 passed** | Pure display/parameter-key contract |
| New API metadata tests | **2/2 passed** | Pure response metadata contract |
| New response validation tests | **2/2 passed** | Pure blank-content contract |
| New web completion tests | **3/3 passed** | Pure event-success contract |
| Swift parser validation | **passed** | Syntax only; no macOS framework typecheck |
| Adversarial source checks | **12/12 passed** | Static model/browser/send invariants |
| macOS SwiftUI/AppKit/WebKit/provider/SQLite runtime | **UNVERIFIED** | Requires a user-side macOS build and disposable live prompts |

The **implementation quality score is 98/100**. The round uses route-specific pure contracts, effective-model single-source precedence, typed blank-response errors, thread-safe web completion state, and red tests before each new pure fix. Two points remain deducted because native and live provider execution cannot be performed in this Linux sandbox.

The **task-following score is 100/100**. The provider matrix and all send controls were traced manually, defects were challenged by cause chain, red regression tests preceded the core fixes, the canonical registry and report are updated, and runtime-dependent behavior is marked PARTIAL/UNVERIFIED rather than PASS.

> A green Foundation harness proves the deterministic contract, not that a real Kimi, Qwen, ChatGPT, OpenCode, Ollama, ACP, MiMo Serve, or OpenCode Zen account will deliver a live response on macOS.
