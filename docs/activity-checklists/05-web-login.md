## Round 54 confirmed defects and fixes

### WEB-LOGIN-11 — empty cookie capture created a false/opaque login state

Capture was available once any page URL existed and passed an empty cookie array to the parent.
That parent persisted an empty store with `try?`, potentially marking metadata active even when the
session could not be restored, while the login sheet gave no actionable reason. Red tests covered
empty/non-empty snapshots, status text, and disk-persistence failure. `WebLoginCaptureLogic` now
rejects empty snapshots. `WebProviderLoginView` leaves the sheet open with an explicit login-required
status, while parent persistence uses `do/catch`, raises a red notification on write failure, and
updates active session metadata only after successful persistence. Targeted tests: **4/4 passed**.

### WEB-LOGIN-12 — built-in detector was misattributed to Auto Free

The provider card said `MiCoder Auto Free will detect models` and `MiCoder Auto Free detected N
models` even though the normal refresh path uses the built-in DOM detector. This violated the user's
explicit requirement for two separate detection actions. `WebDetectionStatusLogic` now produces
honest MiCoder detector text, the header says `Built-in browser detection`, and the second action is
explicitly `Ask MiCoder Auto Free`. AI candidates remain non-selectable until verified by DOM
selection. Targeted tests: **2/2 passed**.

## User story

As a user, I can add a web vendor, log into one or more named accounts in the embedded browser,
capture only a real authenticated session, detect all live models with the built-in browser action,
optionally ask MiCoder Auto Free for review candidates, and use the selected model in the isolated
project/chat browser route. The app must explain failures and never claim a Linux source check is a
macOS/WebKit runtime pass.
