## Round 53 confirmed defects and fixes

### SET-11 — local model chips were visually and logically broken

`LocalProviderRow.isSelected` used `config.models.contains(model)`, so every model in the catalog was
styled as selected. Its `selectModel` handler was an empty comment and had no parent callback, so a
chip tap never changed AppState. The red tests covered provider-scoped visual selection, safe catalog
membership, and provider switching. The fix adds `LocalModelSelectionLogic`, wires the row to select
the provider and model through AppState, and reloads the persisted config after refresh to avoid a
stale parent snapshot. Targeted tests: **3/3 passed**.

### SET-12 — provider form endpoints and API-key defaults were unsafe

`testProvider` built `"rawURL/models"`; Add Provider saved raw whitespace/trailing slashes, accepted
missing schemes, and retained `requiresAPIKey = false` after switching away from OpenCode Zen. The
red tests covered canonical URL, `/models` construction, invalid-input rejection, and all key-default
classes. `ProviderEndpointLogic` now validates HTTP(S) host URLs, trims trailing slashes, normalizes
saved name/key/URL, shows invalid URL guidance, and derives API-key defaults on every type change.
Targeted tests: **3/3 passed**.

### SET-13 — plugin state was display-only

The plugin settings page showed Enabled/Disabled but exposed no button, despite promising enable/
disable management. The red tests covered adding/removing disabled IDs and enabled-state derivation.
The fix adds a visible Enable/Disable action, persists through `PluginEntry.togglePlugin`, reloads the
loader state, and factors the mutation into `PluginToggleLogic`. Targeted tests: **3/3 passed**.

## User story

As a user, I can open Settings and manage appearance, providers, model parameters, local/web/Auto
Free routes, skills, MCP servers, plugins, commands, storage and usage. Every destructive action is
confirmed; every mutable selection persists; and unavailable macOS/network/filesystem behavior is
marked UNVERIFIED rather than claimed as a runtime PASS.
