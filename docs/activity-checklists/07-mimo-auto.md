# Activity 07 — MiCoder Auto Free

> Historical identifiers such as `mimo-auto` remain only for preference migration and `mimoServe` remains the separate local-server transport. The user-facing built-in provider is **MiCoder Auto Free** with OpenCode Zen as its anonymous route.

## Round 56 confirmed defects and TDD fixes

### AUTO-FREE-01 / CHAT-20 — ordinary Auto Free sends dropped conversation history

The direct OpenAI-compatible branch already built prior turns through `ChatHistoryBuilder`, but the
Auto Free branch constructed only one current user message. Consequently a second prompt was sent to
the anonymous model without the previous user/assistant exchange, making ordinary multi-turn work lose
context even though the local chat visibly contained it.

A red Foundation test was written first. The new `MiCoderAutoFreeHistoryLogic` retains finished,
non-empty user/assistant turns, drops in-flight assistant placeholders and caps history at 20 turns;
edge coverage verifies `maxTurns == 0`. `ChatPanelView` now maps the local prior messages into this
contract and prepends them to the current attachment-bearing user message. Evidence: **2/2 pure
history tests passed**.

### PROV-17 — textual HTTP 429/rate-limit errors produced warning-level switches

`MiCoderAutoFreeNotificationLogic` correctly made the exact reason `"rate limit"` red, but
`MiCoderAutoFreeProvider.switchReason` returned `"1 consecutive failures"` for `MiCoderAutoFreeError.apiError("HTTP 429")`. The user therefore received a generic warning instead of the requested red rate-limit alert.

Red tests were written first for HTTP 429 and ordinary “rate limit” text, plus model/generic reason
preservation. `MiCoderAutoFreeFailoverLogic` now normalizes textual errors before notification creation;
API 429 and rate-limit messages use the red error path, while model and generic failures remain distinct.
Evidence: **2/2 pure failover-reason tests passed**.

## Source-traced controls with no additional confirmed defect

The route resolver returns `.autoFree` before Serve fallback, and `SendReadinessLogic` checks the free
catalog independently from local server health. The catalog uses an anonymous request and intersects
live IDs with the temporary free policy; the UI exposes no API-key requirement. Selection and lock
persistence are explicit, and unavailable selected models are reconciled before retry. The stream
client rejects non-free IDs and empty responses, decodes both content and reasoning deltas, and maps
429/400/403/404/410 responses to typed errors. Existing attachment and notification tests cover their
pure contracts.

The following cannot be verified in this Linux environment and remain **UNVERIFIED**: macOS SwiftUI
button hit targets and visual hierarchy, startup timing of the singleton refresh task, live OpenCode
catalog contents, anonymous request acceptance, real SSE chunk delivery, rate-limit behavior, local
session persistence on macOS, and actual request payload capture against the provider.

## Canonical user story

As a user, I can select **MiCoder Auto Free**, choose and optionally lock any currently available
anonymous OpenCode free model, edit a system prompt and parameters, attach supported files/images, and
send multiple contextual turns without starting MiMo Serve or entering an API key. If the selected
model is rate-limited, unavailable or repeatedly fails, the app switches only when unlocked, persists
the new selection, shows a visible reason with red severity for rate limits, and leaves a clear error
when no safe fallback exists.
