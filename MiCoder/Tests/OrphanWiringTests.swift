// Round-7 orphan-wiring RED tests.
//
// The recurring root cause every prior audit round claimed to have eliminated
// ("logic written & tested but never wired into the app") is still present for a
// concrete cluster of modules. These tests assert those modules are invoked from
// LIVE (non-test) source — App/ and Views/ — not merely from their own test file.
//
// They are RED on the unmodified baseline (the orphans are unwired) and turn
// GREEN only once the wiring lands. They are source-inspection lints (the App/
// View files are macOS-only and cannot execute on Linux), so they run in the
// Foundation-only harness and guard against regressions to "defined but dead".

    //    PasteRoutingDecision path. It still has its own passing test suite
    //    ("Chat Paste Routing"), so deleting it is a separate, compile-verified
    //    step — tracked in the Round 7 doc, not force-failed here.
    //  • InputFieldHeightLogic (R7-08): unused utility with a passing suite
    //    ("Input field height"); same reasoning.
    //  • GitignoreEntryLogic: intentionally NOT auto-wired — its own docstring
    //    says it must only run on explicit user action (a feature not yet built),
    //    so it is a documented pending-feature, not an orphan defect.
